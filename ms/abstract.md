## Abstract

Rice yield is influenced by inflorescence size and architecture.
Inflorescences from domesticated accessions produce more branches and grains.
Neither the molecular control of branching nor the developmental differences between wild and domesticated rice accessions are fully understood.
We surveyed phenotypes across 91 wild and domesticated African and Asian accessions and measured gene expression in developing inflorescences.

We recorded phenotypes related to branching, size and grain yield, and used whole transcriptome sequencing to measure gene expression before and after the transition from branching axillary meristems to determinate spikelet meristems.

Characteristics related to axillary meristem identity were the main phenotypic differences between inflorescences from wild and domesticated accessions.
We identified a core set of genes associated with axillary meristem identity in Asian and African rice, and another set associated with phenotypic variability between wild and domesticated accessions.
*AP2/EREBP*-like genes were enriched in both sets, suggesting that they are key factors in inflorescence branching and rice domestication.

Our work has identified new candidates in the molecular control of inflorescence development and yield, and provides an overview of the effects of domestication on phenotype and gene expression.
