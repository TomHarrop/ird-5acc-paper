![Gene expression clusters correlate with the main component of diversity of panicle architecture (PC1) and the number of secondary branches (SBN) and spikelets (SpN).
Clusters contained 19â€“31 genes each (Supporting information Table S8).
(**a**) Mean, scaled log~2~-fold change (L~2~FC) of genes by cluster and accession.
(**b**) Pearson correlation with PC1, SBN and SpN.
PC1 is the main principal component that separates panicles from domesticated and wild accessions of rice (Fig. 1).
Correlations with SBN and SpN are based on repeat panicle phenotyping for the accessions used for RNAseq in greenhouse conditions (Supporting information Fig. S8, Table S10).
