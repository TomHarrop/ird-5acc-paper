![Principal components analysis of transformed read counts for each library.
Principal component 5 (PC5) separates RNAseq samples by developmental stage, and explains 3.5% of total variability.
The first four components explain 86.3% of variability, and separate RNAseq samples by species.
Bars show single samples (three replicates per accession per stage).](figures/Figure_2.pdf)
