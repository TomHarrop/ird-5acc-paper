Principal components analysis of transformed read counts for each library.
Principal component 4 (PC4) separates RNAseq samples by developmental stage, and explains 4.8% of total variability.
The first three components explain 83.1% of variability, and separate RNAseq samples by species.
Bars show single samples (three replicates per accession per stage).](figures/Figure_2.pdf)
