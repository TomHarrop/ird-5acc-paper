![**Figure 6**.
Parallel and divergent evolution of gene expression associated with domestication.
(**a**) Expression of genes with a stage × domestication interaction when all four accessions were tested together.
We used this test to identify genes where the change in L~2~FC between indeterminate (IM) and determinate (DM) stages changed in the same direction in both African and Asian domesticated accessions.
(**b**) Expression of genes with a stage × domestication interaction when tested separately for African and Asian accessions.
These genes have divergent changes between wild and domesticated accessions.
The genes plotted on panel **b** had an interaction in both of the separate tests, but not in the single test used to identify the genes in panel **a**.](figures/Figure_6.pdf){height=88%}
