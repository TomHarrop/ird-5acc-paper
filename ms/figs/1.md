Panicle complexity of 91 rice accessions.
The main component of variablity in panicle phenotypes splits accessions by domestication status, and is related to spikelet number, secondary branch number and primary branch number.
(**a**) We measured traits using spread panicles from *O. rufipogon*, *O. sativa*, *O. barthii* and *O. glaberrima*.
(**b**) The first principal component (PC1) in the panicle phenotype data accounts for 46.5% of variability and separates wild and domesticated accessions independently of continent.
(**c**) Spikelet number (SpN), secondary branch number (SBN) and primary branch number (PBN) have the highest loadings on PC1.
(**d**) Correlation between the main panicle traits that contribute to panicle architecture diversity.
Primary branch number and spikelet number correlate in wild species.
Secondary branch number and spikelet number correlate more in cultivated species than in wild species.
Primary and secondary branch numbers do not correlate.
