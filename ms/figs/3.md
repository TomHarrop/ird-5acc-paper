![**Figure 3**.
*AP2/EREBP*-like and *MADS*-box transcription factors change expression between IM and DM.
For each family, we plotted genes that were in the top 10% of all genes by absolute L~2~FC between IM and DM, without filtering on adjusted *p*-value.
Genes in the upper panels had higher expression at the DM stage, whilst genes in the lower panels had higher expression at the IM stage.
Most *AP2/EREBP*-like genes that pass the 10% cutoff were more highly expressed in the IM.
*AP2/EREBP*-like genes that were more highly expressed in IM mainly belong to the ERF and DREB clades.
In contrast, most *MADS*-box genes that pass the cutoff were more highly expressed at the DM stage.
Clades for *AP2/EREBP*-like genes are from the Plant Transcription Factor Database v4.0 [@jinPlantTFDBCentralHub2017] and @sharoniGeneStructuresClassification2011.
*MADS*-box clades were manually tabulated from @aroraMADSboxGeneFamily2007.
