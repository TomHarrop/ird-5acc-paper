## Results

### Seed number is controlled by how many independent pathways?

### The minimum number of pathways that control panicle architecture

Besides the reference *Oryza sativa nipponbare*, we have selected 4 other rice accessions, one per species: B88 [*Oryza barthii*], Tog5681 [*Oryza glaberrima*], W1654 [*Oryza Rufipogon*], IR64 [*Oryza sativa indica*]. Because they are easily grown in greenhouse, they have sequenced or nearly sequenced genomes and most important they display representative phenotypic traits.

On those accessions, we have measured systematically 9 panicle traits [@faroq2013p]. These traits are:

- Rachis Lengths,
- Primary Branch Numbers,
- Primary Branch Average Lengths,
- Primary Branch Internode Average lengths,
- Secondary Branch Numbers,
- Secondary Branch Numbers,
- Secondary Branch Average Lengths,
- Tertiary Branch Numbers,
- Spikelet Numbers.

Arguably, spikelet number is one of the main outcomes of panicle architecture and one of the main goals of domestication. Thus we consider spikelet number as an outcome and all the other phenotypic traits as potential predictor.

In order to infer the minimum number of independent pathway that determine spikelet number during panicle development, we asked how many panicle traits are necessary to predict spikelet number?

To identify those traits we have performed linear model selection.

The two first principal components of this dataset explain 28.6% and 16.3% of variance

## discussion

Inflorescence branching in Solanaceae is modulated by subtle modifications of transcriptional programs [@Lemmon_Evolutioninflorescencediversity_2016].
