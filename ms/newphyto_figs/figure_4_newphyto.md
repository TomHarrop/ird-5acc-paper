**Figure 4**.
Mutants in two *AP2/EREBP*-like genes, *PLT8* and *ERF142*, have defects in panicle architecture compared to their background accessions.
The *crl5* mutant of *PLT8* (*LOC_Os07g03250*) produced fewer primary branches and spikelets, and the *smos1-3* mutant of *ERF142* (*LOC_Os05g32270*) produced fewer primary branches, secondary branches and spikelets.
