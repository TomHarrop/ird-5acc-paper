**Figure 3**.
*AP2/EREBP*-like and MADS-box transcription factors change expression between IM and DM.
For each family, we plotted genes that were in the top 10% of all genes by absolute loading on PC5.
Genes in the upper panels had a positive loading on PC5 (corresponding to higher expression at the IM stage), whilst genes in the lower panels had a negative loading.
Most *AP2/EREBP*-like genes that pass the 10% cutoff were more highly expressed in the IM.
Three of the four *AP2/EREBP*-like genes that were more highly expressed in the DM belong to the AP2 clade.
*AP2/EREBP*-like genes that were more highly expressed in IM mainly belong to the ERF and DREB clades.
In contrast, most *MADS*-box genes that pass the cutoff were more highly expressed at the DM stage.
Clades for *AP2/EREBP*-like genes are from the Plant Transcription Factor Database v4.0 [@jinPlantTFDBCentralHub2017] and @sharoniGeneStructuresClassification2011.
*MADS*-box clades were manually tabulated from @aroraMADSboxGeneFamily2007.
