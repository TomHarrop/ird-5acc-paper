## Discussion

The purpose of this study was to explore the genetic factors underlying the diversity of panicle architecture, which influences grain number in rice.
Our transcriptomic comparison of panicles at indeterminate and determinate stages of axillary meristem development revealed a core set of transcription factors associated with axillary meristem phase transition in wild and domesticated African and Asian rice.
Some of these transcription factors, including *AP2/EREBP*-like, MIKC^C^-type MADS box, *NAC*, *SBP* and homeobox genes, appear to be co-regulated at the family or clade level.
Our phenotypic survey of 91 accessions showed that characteristics related to axillary meristem formation and fate transition are the main factors separating wild and domesticated rice.
Three clusters of gene expression correlated with the major component of phenotypic variability between wild and domesticated accessions, containing enrichments of *GRF*, *bZIP*, *NAC* and *AP2/EREBP*-like transcription factor genes. 
We observed a correlation between expression of *AP2/EREBP*-like transcription factors, domestication status and derived phenotypes, suggesting that expression of these genes has changed as a result of artificial selection during domestication.
As well as basic insights into molecular control of branching in rice, this work provides an overview of the outcome of the domestication process at phenotypic and whole-transcriptome levels.

A set of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes decrease expression over the course of wheat spike development [@liGenomewideViewTranscriptome2018], and the molecular function of some individual *AP2/EREBP*-like genes has been reported in relation to inflorescence or root development.
*IDS1* controls panicle branching in rice, and positively regulates branch meristem identity by repressing genes that specify spikelet identity [@leeTwoAP2Family2012].
The *PLETHORA*-like gene *PLT9* is associated with root development in rice [@liStructuralCharacterizationExpression2011], and *PLT9* homologs in *Arabidopsis*, *AIL5* and *AIL6*, are involved in floral organ initiation and identity [@krizekAINTEGUMENTALIKEGenesHave2015].
Our results suggest additional roles for both rice *AP2* genes.
Along with *AP2/EREBP85* and *AP2/EREBP86*, *IDS1* and *PLT9* were more highly expressed at the DM stage and had a high loading on the principal component that differentiates stage in all five accessions, consistent with a role in the promotion of determinate axillary meristems.
Most of the detected *AP2/EREBP*-like genes in our dataset that contribute to differences between stage had lower expression in DM than in IM, including mainly ERF and DREB clade genes and three *RAV*-like genes.
In *Arabidopsis*, *RAV* orthologs repress flowering genes [@matias-hernandezRAVGenesRegulation2014], and *ERF3* interacts with the HB gene *WOX11* to promote crown root development [@zhaoInteractionRiceERF32015].
This family- and clade-level view of *AP2/EREBP*-like expression suggests that they play a central role in the regulation of phase transition from indeterminate to determinate state.

A homolog of *IDS1*, the wheat domestication gene *Q*, regulates inflorescence and glume shape and spike length, and has variation in binding sites for microRNA172 between wild and domesticated species [@simonsMolecularCharacterizationMajor2006; @debernardiMicroRNA172PlaysCrucial2017; @greenwoodNewAllelesWheat2017].
Recently, characterisation of a quantitative trait locus associated with grain yield and panicle branching and variation in the promoter region showed that an *AP2/EREBP*-like gene, *FRIZZY PANICLE* (*FZP*), regulates panicle architecture and is associated with rice domestication [@huangVariationRegulatoryRegion2018; @fujishiroComprehensivePaniclePhenotyping2018; @baiDuplicationUpstreamSilencer2017]. 
*FZP* represses the formation of axillary meristem and induces transition from spikelet to floral meristem 
[@komatsuLAX1FRIZZYPANICLE2001].
Our analysis indicates a modified expression pattern of some *AP2/EREBP*-like genes between wild and domesticated rice accessions.
One of the clusters of genes with expression patterns that correlate to the main phenotypic differences between wild and domesticated accessions contained an enrichment of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.
In addition, nine out of the 19 genes with a stage × domestication interaction across the entire dataset were *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.
Seven of these nine genes have lower expression in panicles at the DM stage, and may be involved in promotion of indeterminate axillary meristem and/or suppression of the transition from axillary meristem to spikelet meristem.
Among these genes, *ERF130* (*MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1*, *MFS1*) regulates the timing of the transition of spikelet meristems to termimal spikelets and positively regulates the expression of *IDS1* and *SNB* [@renMULTIFLORETSPIKELET1Which2013].
We also found a stage × domestication interaction in expression of *IDS1*, but the change was divergent between African and Asian accessions.
This suggests that even if genes are involved in similar regulatory networks, their expression may diverge during selection.
Similarly, evolution of shattering and awn phenotypes during domestication is associated with different loci in *O. sativa* and *O. glaberrima* [@cubryRiseFallAfrican2018; @lvGeneticControlSeed2018a; @furutaConvergentLossAwn2015].
Nevertheless, taken with the known roles of *AP2* mutants in modification of rice panicle architecture [@leeTwoAP2Family2012; @komatsuLAX1FRIZZYPANICLE2001], our results implicate several *AP2/EREBP*-like genes as putative targets of artificial selection during rice domestication resulting in parallel evolution of expression.

Domesticated Asian rice panicles produce more primary and secondary branches than *O. rufipogon* panicles [@yamakiDiversityPanicleBranching2010].
Our interspecific analysis showed that parallel domestication of African and Asian rice resulted in similar modifications in panicle architecture, with changes in branch number contributing to derived phenotypes more than branch length traits.
Secondary branch number correlated with spikelet number in all species, but primary branch number only correlates with spikelet number in wild species.
Yield improvements seem to have occurred mainly through increased ramification of branching, rather than *e.g.* elongation of the primary axis.
This suggests that increased production of secondary branches from axillary meristems rather than direct differentiation into spikelets was important in both domestications.

Microarray analysis of developing panicles has identified a small set of genes, enriched for TFs, that is differentially expressed during rice panicle development [@furutaniGenomewideAnalysisSpatial2006].
In microdissected meristem tissues, gene expression changes gradually during transition in axillary meristem identity [@harropGeneExpressionProfiling2016], similar to the gradual meristem maturation during tomato inflorescence development [@parkRateMeristemMaturation2012].
We also observed a small set of genes that were differentially expressed between IM and DM consistently in all accessions (193 of 25,229 tested), with an enrichment of TFs (38 of 193 genes).
More genes were upregulated in DM than down-regulated, as in wheat spike development [@wangTranscriptomeAssociationIdentifies2017].
These results suggest that the gene regulatory network controlling phase transition from IM to DM is controlled by a small subset of core, conserved genes in Asian and African rice.

Because of redundant and overlapping activities of TFs, gene regulatory networks are robust to perturbations in single genes, allowing them to produce a stable transcriptional output in variable cellular and environmental conditions [@wuFunctionalRedundancyTranscription2015; @gitterBackupGeneRegulatory2009; @daiRobustnessTranscriptionalRegulatory2009].
*AP2/EREBP*-like, MADS-box, Homeobox, *NAC* and *SBP* TF genes were all enriched either in the list of differentially expressed genes or the list of genes that had a high loading on the component of variability that separated RNAseq samples by stage.
Expression of *AGL6*-like, *AP1*/*FUL*-like, and four of the five *SEPELATTA*-like MADS-box genes all increased between indeterminate and determinate stage, as expected given their roles in spikelet determination and inflorescence development [@yoshidaTAWAWA1RegulatorRice2013; @zhangMolecularControlGrass2014].
This suggests family-level or clade-level co-regulation of TFs in rice panicle development.
Our observation that some genes appear to be co-expressed at the family or clade level may indiciate partial functional redundancy between groups of homologous TFs in the rice genome that act in the gene regulatory network controlling axillary meristem determination.

This work has revealed the core set of genes that are associated with the determination of axillary meristem identity across Asian and African rice accessions.
We have also discovered candidate targets of artificial selection on panicle phenotype during domestication.
In particular, the interspecific expression patterns of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes suggests that they regulate axillary meristem determination and have evolved during domestication.
Along with efforts to characterise the molecular function of the candidate genes we have identified, modelling the gene regulatory network controlling meristem identity at the single-cell level would continue to drive an understanding of the process of inflorescence development in rice and its relationship to grain yield.
