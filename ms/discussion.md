## Discussion

### Summary paragraph

The purpose of this study was to explore the genetic factors underlying the diversity of panicle architecture, which influences grain number in rice.
Our transcriptomic comparison of panicles from panicles at indeterminate and determinate stages of axillary meristem development revealed a core set of transcription factors associated with axillary meristem phase transition in wild and domesticated African and Asian rice.
Some of these transcription factors, including *AP2/EREBP*-like, MIKC^C^-type MADS box, *NAC*, *SBP* and homeobox genes, appear to be co-regulated at the family or clade level.
Our phenotypic survey of 91 accessions showed that characteristics related to axillary meristem formation and fate transition are the main factors separating wild and domesticated rice.
We observed a correlation between expression of *AP2/EREBP*-like transcription factors, domestication status and derived phenotypes, suggesting that expression of these genes has changed as a result of artificial selection during domestication.
As well as basic insights into molecular control of the branching process in rice, this work provides an overview of the outcome of the domestication process at phenotypic and whole-transcriptome levels.

### Ap2 branching paragraph

The molecular function of some individual *AP2/EREBP*-like genes has been reported in relation to inflorescence or root development.
*IDS1* controls panicle branching in rice, and positively regulates branch meristem identity by repressing genes that specify spikelet identity [@leeTwoAP2Family2012].
The *PLETHORA*-like gene *PLT9* is associated with root development in rice [@liStructuralCharacterizationExpression2011], and *PLT9* homologs in *Arabidopsis*, *AIL5* and *AIL6*, are involved in floral organ initiation and identity [@krizekAINTEGUMENTALIKEGenesHave2015].
Our results suggest additional roles for both rice *AP2* genes.
Along with *AP2/EREBP85* and *AP2/EREBP86*, *IDS1* and *PLT9* were more highly expressed at the DM stage and had a high loading on the principal component that differentiates stage in all five accessions, consistent with a role in the promotion of determinate axillary meristems.
At the family level, a set of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes decrease expression over the course of wheat spike development [@liGenomewideViewTranscriptome2018].
In *Arabidopsis*, *RAV* orthologs repress flowering genes [@matias-hernandezRAVGenesRegulation2014], and *ERF3* interacts with the HB gene *WOX11* to promote crown root development [@zhaoInteractionRiceERF32015].
Most of the detected *AP2/EREBP*-like genes in our dataset that contribute to differences between stage had lower expression in DM than in IM, including mainly ERF and DREB clade genes and three *RAV*-like genes.
This family- and clade-level view of *AP2/EREBP*-like expression suggests that they play a central role in the regulation of phase transition from indeterminate to determinate state.

### Ap2 domestication paragraph

A homolog of *IDS1*, the wheat domestication gene *Q*, regulates inflorescence and glume shape and spike length, and has variation in binding sites for microRNA172 between wild and domesticated species [@simonsMolecularCharacterizationMajor2006; @debernardiMicroRNA172PlaysCrucial2017; @greenwoodNewAllelesWheat2017].
Recently, characterisation of a quantitative trait locus associated with grain yield and panicle branching and variation in the promoter region showed that an *AP2/EREBP*-like gene, *FRIZZY PANICLE* (*FZP*), regulates panicle architecture and is associated with domestication [@huangVariationRegulatoryRegion2018; @fujishiroComprehensivePaniclePhenotyping2018; @baiDuplicationUpstreamSilencer2017]. 
*FZP* represses the formation of axillary meristem and induces transition from spikelet to floral meristem 
[@komatsuLAX1FRIZZYPANICLE2001].
Our analysis indicates a modified expression pattern of some *AP2/EREBP*-like genes between wild and domesticated rice accessions.
One of the clusters of genes with expression patterns that correlate to the main phenotypic differences between wild and domesticated accessions contained an enrichment of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.
In addition, nine out of the 19 genes with a stage × domestication interaction across the entire dataset were *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.
Seven of these nine genes have lower expression in panicles at the DM stage, and may be involved in promotion of indeterminate axillary meristem and/or suppression of the transition from axillary meristem to spikelet meristem.
Among these genes, *ERF130* (*MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1*, *MFS1*) regulates the timing of the transition of spikelet meristems to termimal spikelets and positively regulates the expression of *IDS1* and *SNB* [@renMULTIFLORETSPIKELET1Which2013].
We also found a stage × domestication interaction in expression of *IDS1*, but the change was divergent between African and Asian accessions.
This suggests that even if genes are involved in similar regulatory networks, their expression may diverge during selection.
Similarly, evolution of shattering and awn phenotypes during domestication is associated with different loci in *O. sativa* and *O. glaberrima* [@cubryRiseFallAfrican2018; @lvGeneticControlSeed2018a; @furutaConvergentLossAwn2015].
Nevertheless, taken with the known roles of *AP2* mutants in modification of rice panicle architecture [@leeTwoAP2Family2012; @komatsuLAX1FRIZZYPANICLE2001], our results implicate several *AP2/EREBP*-like genes as putative targets of artificial selection during rice domestication resulting in parallel evolution of expression.

### phenotypes paragraph

Domesticated Asian rice panicles produce more primary and secondary branches than *O. rufipogon* panicles [@yamakiDiversityPanicleBranching2010].
Our interspecific analysis showed that parallel domestication of African and Asian rice resulted in similar modifications in panicle architecture, with changes in branch number contributing to derived phenotypes more than branch length traits.
Secondary branch number correlated with spikelet number in all species, but primary branch number only correlates with spikelet number in wild species.
Yield improvements seem to have occurred mainly through increased ramification of branching, rather than *e.g.* elongation of the primary axis.
This suggests that increased production of secondary branches from axillary meristems rather than direct differentiation into spikelets was important in both domestications.
Three clusters of gene expression correlated with the major component of variability between wild and domesticated accessions, containing enrichments of *GRF*, *bZIP*, *NAC* and *AP2/EREBP*-like transcription factor genes.
