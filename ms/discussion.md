> Rice is one of the most important food crops for more than half of the worldâ€™s population and is also considered as a model species for important agronomic traits for grasses. Rice yield is known as a complex agronomic trait that is determined by three related traits: number of inflorescence (i.e. panicle) per plant, number of grain per panicle and grain weight [@xingGeneticMolecularBases2010]. While the grain weight is determined by grain size (length, width and thickness) and the degree of filling, the number of panicle is dependent on tillering ability. The number of grains per panicle is dependent on the panicle size and architecture.
