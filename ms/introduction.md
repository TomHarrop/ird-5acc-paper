# Introduction

Rice produces grains on branched inflorescences called panicles.
The complexity of panicle branching and the number of grains that grow on it are determined by iterations of two basic developmental decisions [**outcomes?**]: How many axillary meristems a branch produces, and whether an axillary meristem grows into a higher order branch or differentiates into a spikelet and potentially a grain.
In detail, the rice panicle develops from a main stem called the rachis, which produces a small indeterminate number of axillary meristems during elongation.
The axillary meristems on the rachis all develop as primary branches.
Primary branches also produce an indeterminate number of axillary meristems. The axillary meristems on the primary branches either grow as secondary branches or differentiate into spikelets.
Secondary branches also produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems, most of which differentiate into spikelets. Some axillary meristems on the secondary branch may grow into tertiary branches.
Each rice grain is produced from a single spikelet.
These developmental [**decisions/outcomes**] shape the complexity of rice panicles.

Panicle branching and the number of grains per panicle is variable among the clades, species and varieties that have evolved during the complex domestication history of rice.
Asian and African clades of rice split around two millions years ago and were domesticated independently [@zhu2005phylogenetic].
The domesticated Asian rice *Oryza sativa* appeared 10,000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *O. sativa* ssp. *indica* and *O. sativa* ssp. *japonica*, and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *Oryza rufipogon*.
Rice species in this Asian clade tend to produce panicles with more branches and more grains.
The domesticated African rice *Oryza glaberrima* has a simpler histor. It was domesticated 3000 years ago, and introgressions from its wild relative, *Oryza barthii*, have not been detected [Reviewed by @vaughan2008evolving].
Rice species in the African clade tend to produce simpler panicles, [**with branching complexity mostly determined by?**] the number of primary branches.
In both African and Asian rice clades, when compared to their wild relatives, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified.

The topology and quantity of panicle branches are controlled by genes that determine the size, rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems.
The activity of some of those genes is not limited to the reproductive phase, but it spans many developmental phases. **i suggest removing this sentence-maybe confusing?**
The branching gene *G1L5* (*TAWAWA1*) is an ALOG transcription factor that promotes indeterminate apical meristem [@yoshida2013tawawa1].
In contrast, the genes *LAX PANICLE 1* and *LAX PANICLE 2* control the establishment of axillary meristem, which affects both vegetative and panicle branching [@komatsu2001lax1, @tabuchi2011lax].
The rice homologs of *Arabidopsis* *UFO*, *ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1* and *Aberrant Panicle organization 2* (**is APO2 *RFL*/*FLO-LFY HOMOLOG OF RICE*?**), control meristem phase transitions. Mutants in *APO1* and *RFL* have reduced branching [@ikeda2012aberrant].

***I am not sure which other gene to discuss here, which one do we consider focal for our paper? If we include more genes we could consider dividing them in -indeterminate apical meristem, establishment of axyllary meristem, progression to spikelet.***

> Maybe IDS1? But I think this is already enough, don't need to review all the known branching genes to talk about AP2.

While some genes that determine panicle branching in rice have been described, the diversity of branching across rice species and the genetics underlying the diversity have not been systematically studied.

In this paper we analyse panicle branching in  more than 100 varieties (**exact number**?) from the African wild species *O. barthii*, the African domesticated species *O. glaberrima*, the Asian wild species *O. rufipogon* and the Asian domesticated species *O. sativa indica* and *O. sativa japonica*. We used whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing on developing and branching panicles from five varieties to investigate changes in gene expression relating to panicle branching and domestication. We found **conclusions**.
