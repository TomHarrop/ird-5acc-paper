# Introduction

Rice produces grains on complex racemo inflorescences called panicles (**suppl-figure-panicle**).
The architecture of the rice panicle results from the establishment and activity of apical and axillary meristems derived from the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM) (Ikeda et al., 2004; Breeding Science 54, 147-156).
*If you close this sentence with "Vegetative shoot apical meristems", it seems that this is going to be the topic of the next sentences. Moreover, we never deal with the vegetative shoot apical meristem, so I don't see why we should mention it*

> TH: I can go either way on this. Maybe the SAM is worth mentioning but the vegetative/reproductive transition is too much detail, for a general audience?
The complexity of panicle branching and the number of grains that grow on it are determined by iterations of two basic developmental decisions on axillary meristems: How many axillary meristems are produced, and whether an axillary meristem grows into a higher order branch or differentiates into a spikelet and then a grain (**in other word is meristem fate transition from branch/axillary to spikelet meristem**).

After the floral transition, the vegetative shoot meristem develops into a rachis meristem, which produces axillary meristems until the rachis meristem is active.
The axillary meristems on the rachis all develop as primary branches.
Primary branches produce then an indeterminate number of axillary meristems. The axillary meristems on the primary branches either grow as secondary branches or differentiate into spikelets.
Secondary branches also produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems, which very rarely grow into tertiary branches and most likely differentiate into spikelets. Each rice grain is produced from a single spikelet.
These developmental decisions shape the complexity of rice panicles; the morphology of panicle development is reviewed in detail by [Itoh et al, 2005, https://doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pci501].

Morphologically, the full panicle architecture is developed and determined quickly after its appearance. Panicle development starts from the rachis meristem.
The rachis meristem elongates and, starting from its base, it produces an undetermined number of primary branch meristems. In turn the primary branches elongate and produce an undetermined number of axillary meristems which grow into secondary branches or differentiate into spikelets.
The morphology of panicle development is described by Ikeda et al. (2004  https://doi.org/10.1270/jsbbs.54.147)

The number of grains is one of the important characters specifying rice yield.

Panicle branching and the number of grains per panicle change among the clades, species and varieties of rice, especially between wild and domesticated varieties.(**Panicule diversity (yamaki et al., 2010 10.1270/jsbbs.60.586 ; Taguch)-Shiobara et al., 2011 10.1270/jsbbs.61.52**)
Two rice species were domesticated independently from the AA genome wild Oryza rice in Africa and in Asia (REF..).
Asian and African clades of rice split around two millions years ago and were domesticated independently [@zhuPhylogeneticRelationshipsAgenome2005].
The domesticated Asian rice *Oryza sativa* appeared 10,000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *O. sativa* ssp. *indica* and *O. sativa* ssp. *japonica*, and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *Oryza rufipogon*.
The domesticated African rice *Oryza glaberrima* has a simpler history. It was domesticated 3000 years ago, without introgressions from its wild relative, *Oryza barthii*[Reviewed by @vaughanEvolvingStoryRice2008].
In both African and Asian clades, when compared to their wild relatives, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified.
Compared with wild relatives, domesticated rice species share similar traits, such as loss of seed shattering, an erect growth tiller, short awn or awnless seed (â€¦ref)

> *Again, we never deal with those traits, I agree that it might be interesting to mention them, but it might also complicate things when not necessary.*.
> TH: if we want to discuss these phenotypes, we could fit it in the domestication section of the discussion.
Especially, in both African and Asian clades, the panicles of domesticated species tend to produce more branches and eventually more grains. (10.1093/aob/mcm128). (**ref to DOI 10.1186/s13227-017-0065-y and another one for asia; refer also to GWAS paper in vietnamese collecte**).

The topology and quantity of panicle branches are controlled by genes that determine the size, rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems
Many of those genes have been described.
The branching gene *G1L5* (*TAWAWA1*) is an ALOG transcription factor that promotes indeterminate apical meristem [@yoshidaTAWAWA1RegulatorRice2013].
In contrast, the genes *LAX PANICLE 1* and *LAX PANICLE 2* encode for a bHLH and a novel domain protein and determine the establishment of axillary meristem, which affects both vegetative and panicle branching [@komatsuLAX1FRIZZYPANICLE2001, @tabuchiLAXPANICLE2Rice2011].
The rice homologs of *Arabidopsis* *UFO*, *ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1* and *Aberrant Panicle organization 2* (**is APO2 *RFL*/*FLO-LFY HOMOLOG OF RICE*?**), control meristem phase transitions. In the *APO1* or *RFL* mutants, axillary meristem differentiate into spikelets more frequently. This reduces branching [@ikeda-kawakatsuABERRANTPANICLEORGANIZATION2012].
Also the gene *Frizzy Panicle* (*FZP*) determines the spikelet meristem identity and in its absence the panicle produces a massive number of axillary meristems which do not develop into spikelets [Komatsu et al., 2003; doi: 10.1242/dev.00564]. Moreover, The *FZP* gene is connected to grain yield, high order branching and domestication [Bai et al. 2017, 10.1038/s41477-017-0042-4; Ren et al., 2018 10.1093/jxb/ery264; Huang et al., 2018, 10.1111/tpj.14062, Fujishiro et al., 2018  10.1038/s41598-018-30395-9].

***I am not sure which other gene to discuss here, which one do we consider focal for our paper? If we include more genes we could consider dividing them in -indeterminate apical meristem, establishment of axyllary meristem, progression to spikelet.***
>Refer to Harrop et al., 2016 : 10.1111/tpj.13147; gene expression profiling of reproductive meristemss types...understanding dvt but not diversity
> Maybe IDS1? But I think this is already enough, don't need to review all the known branching genes to talk about AP2.
> important to talk about recent AP2 paper : FZP : 3 papers have just been published and one related to domestication in sativa, 10.1038/s41598-018-30395-9; 10.1038/s41477-017-0042-4; 10.1038/ncomms3200


While genes that determine panicle branching in rice have been described, the diversity of branching across rice species and the genetics underlying it have not been systematically studied.

First, in this paper we measure and summarize panicle features of wild and domesticated, African and Asian rice varieties. We have selected of 93 rice varieties from the African wild species *O. barthii*, the African domesticated species *O. glaberrima*, the Asian wild species *O. rufipogon* and the Asian domesticated species *O. sativa* spp *indica* and *O. sativa* spp *japonica* and hereby we summarize the main differences among continent and domestication groups.

Then, we sample the transcriptome of developing panicles of 5 selected species, to describe the genetic of branching and its diversity. Here we sequence whole-transcriptome RNA of panicles at indeterminate branch meristem (BM) and determined spikelet meristem (SM) stages of development from those varieties and report changes in gene expression relating to panicle branching and domestication.
