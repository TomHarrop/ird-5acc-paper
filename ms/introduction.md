# Introduction

Rice produces grains on complex multi-branched inflorescences, called panicles.
The complexity of a panicle and eventually the number of grains that develop on it are determined by the iteration of two basic developmental decisions about axillary meristems: (i) How many axillary meristem should a branch produce, and (ii) should a single axillary meristem grow into a secondary order branch or differentiate into a spikelet and eventually into a grain.
~~Multiple developmental events determine the panicle branch structure and eventually its number of grains~~.
In detail, the rice panicle develops from a main stem named Rachis, which, while growing, produces in spiral phyllotaxis an indeterminate number axillary meristems.
All of those meristems develop as primary branches.
Primary branches also produces in alternate phyllotaxis an indeterminate number of axillary meristems, any of those meristems could develop as secondary branches or could differentiate into spikelets.
Also secondary branches produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems which rarely develop into tertiary branches and likely all differentiate into spikelets.
One rice spikelet produces one single grain.
These events determine the complexity of rice panicles.

Panicle structure and number of grains per panicle change consistently among the many species and varieties of African and Asian, domesticated and wild rices, which evolved during rice complex domestication history. Asian and African rice split around two millions years ago and have been domesticated independently. [@zhu2005phylogenetic]. The domesticated Asian rice *O. Sativa* appeared 10000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *indica* and *sativa* and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *O. rufipogon*. Instead, the african rice *O. glaberrima* has simpler history: it was domesticated only 3000 years ago and doesn't show signs of introgressions from its wild relative *O. barthii* [Reviewed by @vaughan2008evolving]. Asian rice tends to produced more ramified panicles and more secondary branches; In both rice clades, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified. But the diversity of rice panicle wasn't yet described thoroughly and systematically.
