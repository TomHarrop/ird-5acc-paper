# Introduction

Rice produces grains on much branched inflorescences called panicles.
The complexity of panicle branching and the number of grains that grow on it are determined by iterations of two basic developmental decisions on axillary meristems: How many axillary meristems a branch produces, and whether an axillary meristem grows into a higher order branch or differentiates into a spikelet and then a grain.
In detail, the rice panicle develops from a main stem called the rachis, which produces a small indeterminate number of axillary meristems during elongation.
The axillary meristems on the rachis all develop as primary branches.
Primary branches also produce an indeterminate number of axillary meristems. The axillary meristems on the primary branches either grow as secondary branches or differentiate into spikelets.
Secondary branches also produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems, which very rarely grow into tertiary branches and most likely differentiate into spikelets.
Each rice grain is produced from a single spikelet.
These developmental decisions shape the complexity of rice panicles.

Panicle branching and the number of grains per panicle is variable among the clades, species and varieties that have evolved during the complex domestication history of rice.
Asian and African clades of rice split around two millions years ago and were domesticated independently [@zhu2005phylogenetic].
The domesticated Asian rice *Oryza sativa* appeared 10,000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *O. sativa* ssp. *indica* and *O. sativa* ssp. *japonica*, and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *Oryza rufipogon*.
Rice species in this Asian clade tend to produce panicles with more branches and more grains.
The domesticated African rice *Oryza glaberrima* has a simpler history. It was domesticated 3000 years ago, and introgressions from its wild relative, *Oryza barthii*, have not been detected [Reviewed by @vaughan2008evolving].
Rice species in the African clade tend to produce simpler panicles, with mostly primary branches [**I am not sure how much of this is already known and how much is our finding, I'll search bibliography a bit more, any suggestion?**].
In both African and Asian clades, when compared to their wild relatives, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified.

The topology and quantity of panicle branches are controlled by genes that determine the size, rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems.
Many of those genes have been described.
The branching gene *G1L5* (*TAWAWA1*) is an ALOG transcription factor that promotes indeterminate apical meristem [@yoshida2013tawawa1].
In contrast, the genes *LAX PANICLE 1* and *LAX PANICLE 2* encode for a bHLH and a novel domain protein and determine the establishment of axillary meristem, which affects both vegetative and panicle branching [@komatsu2001lax1, @tabuchi2011lax].
The rice homologs of *Arabidopsis* *UFO*, *ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1* and *Aberrant Panicle organization 2* (**is APO2 *RFL*/*FLO-LFY HOMOLOG OF RICE*?**), control meristem phase transitions. In the *APO1* or *RFL* mutants, axillary meristem differentiate into spikelets more frequently. This reduces branching [@ikeda2012aberrant].

***I am not sure which other gene to discuss here, which one do we consider focal for our paper? If we include more genes we could consider dividing them in -indeterminate apical meristem, establishment of axyllary meristem, progression to spikelet.***

> Maybe IDS1? But I think this is already enough, don't need to review all the known branching genes to talk about AP2.

While genes that determine panicle branching in rice have been described, the diversity of branching across rice species and the genetics underlying it have not been systematically studied.

First, in this paper we measure and summarize panicle features of wild and domesticated, African and Asian rice varieties. We have selected of 91 [**please confirm**] rice varieties from the African wild species *O. barthii*, the African domesticated species *O. glaberrima*, the Asian wild species *O. rufipogon* and the Asian domesticated species *O. sativa* spp *indica* and *O. sativa* spp *japonica* and hereby we summarize the main differences among continent and domestication groups.

Then, we sample the transcriptome of developing panicles of 5 selected species, to describe the genetic of branching and its diversity. Here we sequence whole-transcriptome RNA of panicles at indeterminate branch meristem (BM) and determined spikelet meristem (SM) stages of development from those varieties and report changes in gene expression relating to panicle branching and domestication.

> OM: I've split the anticipation in two paragraph, because otherwise the transcriptomic part gets lost in the middle of the paragraph. If we want only one paragraph we have to decide what part is more important: phenotype or transcriptome and then we should put that one in evidence.

We found **conclusions**.

> OM: I prefer to keep the conclusions out of the introduction, because I feel that they don't belong there. But if we want to add them, we can, once the results and discussion are done.
