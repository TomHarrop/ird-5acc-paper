# Introduction
>suggestion for an introduction plan
- general sentence about importance of rice and so panicle architecture
    - OM: I'm not sure that we should discuss general importance of rice. The importance of rice is very well known, and we do not address it directly in this paper.
    The first paragraph introduces panicle architecture, but I would not be sure how to state its importance. Is it more important then the rest of the plant?
- how the panicle is formed: description of morphological step
    - OM: Great ,I'll add that
- what we know about molecular control
    - OM: Isn't this in the third paragraph?
- what about panicle diversity in rice and relation with domestication / refer also to paper in tomato and wheat in transcriptomic analysis (10.1101/gr.207837.116; 10.1104/pp.17.00694)

> OM: Hi,this is my reasoning behind Introduction, I was trying to keep it simple and consistent with our analysis:
- What is a panicle, how is it structured, where does its diversity arises.
    - To introduce generically the main topic.
- What is panicle diversity in different rice species and in domestication.
    - To introduce the fact that panicle diversity has not been described yet systematically and to motivate the first part our work.
- What is the molecular control of panicle development and panicle diversity
    - To introduce the second part of our work.
- What is our aim and what we have done: an exploration of panicle diversity in different species of wild and domesticated rice and of the underlying molecular genetics



Rice produces grains on much-branched inflorescences called panicles.The rice panicle consist of several hierachical orders of branchs (**ref to general figure of panicle+ description?** - OM - maybe in the supplementary.).
The architecture of the rice inflorescence (panicle) results from the establishment and activity of apical and axillary meristems derived from the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM) (Ikeda et al., 2004; Breeding Science 54, 147-156). *If you write it like this, you put the stress on "vegetative shoot apical meristem, which is not what we are talking about in this paragraph."*
The complexity of panicle branching and the number of grains that grow on it are determined by iterations of two basic developmental decisions on axillary meristems: How many axillary meristems are produced, and whether an axillary meristem grows into a higher order branch or differentiates into a spikelet and then a grain (**in other word is meristem fate transition from branch/axillary to spiklet meristem**).
After the floral transition, the vegetative shoot meristem develops into a rachis meristem, which produces axillary meristems until the rachis meristem is active. The axillary meristems on the rachis all develop as primary branches.
Primary branches produce then an indeterminate number of axillary meristems. The axillary meristems on the primary branches either grow as secondary branches or differentiate into spikelets.
Secondary branches also produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems, which very rarely grow into tertiary branches and most likely differentiate into spikelets. Each rice grain is produced from a single spikelet.
These developmental decisions shape the complexity of rice panicles.

> OM: I'm not sure, it is all general knowledge. I could check old papers for botanical morphological description (any suggestion?), or find something on development and axillary meristems.

The number of grains is one of the important characters specifying rice yield. *Sorry for the many critics, but this is pretty obvious, isn't it?* Panicle branching and the number of grains per panicle is variable among the clades, species and varieties that have evolved during the complex domestication history of rice.(**Panicule diversity (yamaki et al., 2010 10.1270/jsbbs.60.586 ; Taguch)-Shiobara et al., 2011 10.1270/jsbbs.61.52**)
Two rice species were domesticated independently from the AA genome wild Oryza rice in Africa and in Asia (REF..). Compared with wild progenitors, the two cultivated rice species share a common set of morphological traits, such as loss of seed shatering, an erect growth tiller and short awn or awnless seed (â€¦ref). In this context, the panicle architecture is one of the main morphological traits modified during rice domestications (10.1093/aob/mcm128)

Asian and African clades of rice split around two millions years ago and were domesticated independently [@zhu2005phylogenetic].
The domesticated Asian rice *Oryza sativa* appeared 10,000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *O. sativa* ssp. *indica* and *O. sativa* ssp. *japonica*, and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *Oryza rufipogon*.
The domesticated African rice *Oryza glaberrima* has a simpler history. It was domesticated 3000 years ago, without introgressions from its wild relative, *Oryza barthii*[Reviewed by @vaughan2008evolving].
In both African and Asian clades, when compared to their wild relatives, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified (**ref to DOI 10.1186/s13227-017-0065-y and another one for asia; refer also to GWAS paper in vietnamese collecte**).

The topology and quantity of panicle branches are controlled by genes that determine the size, rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems
Many of those genes have been described.
The branching gene *G1L5* (*TAWAWA1*) is an ALOG transcription factor that promotes indeterminate apical meristem [@yoshida2013tawawa1].
In contrast, the genes *LAX PANICLE 1* and *LAX PANICLE 2* encode for a bHLH and a novel domain protein and determine the establishment of axillary meristem, which affects both vegetative and panicle branching [@komatsu2001lax1, @tabuchi2011lax].
The rice homologs of *Arabidopsis* *UFO*, *ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1* and *Aberrant Panicle organization 2* (**is APO2 *RFL*/*FLO-LFY HOMOLOG OF RICE*?**), control meristem phase transitions. In the *APO1* or *RFL* mutants, axillary meristem differentiate into spikelets more frequently. This reduces branching [@ikeda2012aberrant].

***I am not sure which other gene to discuss here, which one do we consider focal for our paper? If we include more genes we could consider dividing them in -indeterminate apical meristem, establishment of axyllary meristem, progression to spikelet.***
>Refer to Harrop et al., 2016 : 10.1111/tpj.13147; gene expression profiling of reproductive meristemss types...understanding dvt but not diversity
> Maybe IDS1? But I think this is already enough, don't need to review all the known branching genes to talk about AP2.
> important to talk about recent AP2 paper : FZP : 3 papers have just been published and one related to domestication in sativa, 10.1038/s41598-018-30395-9; 10.1038/s41477-017-0042-4; 10.1038/ncomms3200


While genes that determine panicle branching in rice have been described, the diversity of branching across rice species and the genetics underlying it have not been systematically studied.

First, in this paper we measure and summarize panicle features of wild and domesticated, African and Asian rice varieties. We have selected of 93 rice varieties from the African wild species *O. barthii*, the African domesticated species *O. glaberrima*, the Asian wild species *O. rufipogon* and the Asian domesticated species *O. sativa* spp *indica* and *O. sativa* spp *japonica* and hereby we summarize the main differences among continent and domestication groups.

Then, we sample the transcriptome of developing panicles of 5 selected species, to describe the genetic of branching and its diversity. Here we sequence whole-transcriptome RNA of panicles at indeterminate branch meristem (BM) and determined spikelet meristem (SM) stages of development from those varieties and report changes in gene expression relating to panicle branching and domestication.

> OM: I've split the anticipation in two paragraph, because otherwise the transcriptomic part gets lost in the middle of the paragraph. If we want only one paragraph we have to decide what part is more important: phenotype or transcriptome and then we should put that one in evidence.

We found **conclusions**.

> OM: I prefer to keep the conclusions out of the introduction, because I feel that they don't belong there. But if we want to add them, we can, once the results and discussion are done.
