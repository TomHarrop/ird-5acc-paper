## Introduction

Grain yield in rice is linked to inflorescence branching [**was cited: (Doebley et al., 2006; Olsen and Wendel, 2013).**].
Inflorescence size and architecture are key targets in selective breeding for improved rice grain yield and quality [**find refs (Doust, 2007; Wang and Li, 2011)**], and as a result, these characteristics have changed during domestication.

Inflorescence branching and the number of grains per inflorescence varies between clades, species and accessions (Panicle diversity (yamaki et al., 2010 10.1270/jsbbs.60.586 ; Taguch)-Shiobara et al., 2011 10.1270/jsbbs.61.52).
Asian and African clades of rice diverged around two million years ago and were domesticated independently (Zhu & Ge, 2005).
Domesticated Asian rice, *Oryza sativa*, appeared (**what do you mean by appeared? speciation started?**) 10,000 years ago.
*O. sativa* is the product of a complex domestication process from the wild Asian rice species, *Oryza rufipogon*.
The *O. sativa* species complex involves a network of subspecies, including *O. sativa indica* and *O. sativa japonica* (Huang et al., 2012 10.1038/nature11532; Choi et al., 2017. doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx049; Stein et al., 2018 doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0040-0).
Domesticated African rice, *Oryza glaberrima*, has a simpler history.
It was domesticated from its wild relative, *Oryza barthii*, 3,000 years ago, without subsequent introgression (Vaughan et al., 2008: Cubry et al., 2018 10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.066).
In both African and Asian clades, domesticated species produce inflorescences that are more complex and ramified than their wild relatives (Yamaki et al., 2010 ; Linares, 2002; Ta et al., 2017).

Rice produces grains on complex raceme inflorescences called panicles, which consist of a series of branches of different orders.
The rachis is the main axis, and primary, secondary and tertiary branches are higher-order axes (suppl-figure-panicle).
This structure is established early after floral transition.
The vegetative shoot meristem develops into a reproductive rachis meristem, which produces axillary meristems until its abortion.
The axillary meristems on the rachis all develop as primary branches.
Primary branches produce a variable number of axillary meristems, which differentiate into secondary branches, and may also produce tertiary branch meristems. 
Finally, all axillary meristem and terminal meristems differentiate gradually from the top to the base of the panicle into spikelet meristems and then florets.
Each rice grain is produced from a single spikelet (reviewed by [Itoh et al, 2005, doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pci501]).

The complexity of panicle branching and the number of grains are determined by two basic developmental decisions (**don't know about "decisions". outcomes?**): how many axillary meristems are produced, and whether an axillary meristem grows into a higher order branch or differentiates into a spikelet and then a grain. 
The rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems are controlled by transcriptional regulators, some of which have been identified in *O. sativa* (Xing and Zhang, 2010; Wang and Li, 2011).
Genes including *G1L5* (*TAWAWA*), *LAX1* and *LAX2* control the branching phase via establishment and activity of indeterminate meristems (Yoshida et al., 2013 Komatsu et al., 2001, @tabuchiLAXPANICLE2Rice2011).
Genes such as *SNB*, *FZP* and  *LHS1* regulate the transition from indeterminate meristems to determinate spikelet meristems and the subsequent transition from spikelet to floret meristem (jeon et al., 2000; Komatsu et al., 2033; Agrawal et al//; 2005; chen et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006).
Panicle complexity in *O. sativa* is governed by fine-tuning of meristem fate transitions via the differential regulation of genes involved in the spikelet transition (Kyozuka et al., 2014).

Despite advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate panicle branching in rice (Furutani et al., 2006; Harrop et al., 2016) and  characterization of individual genes associated with variation in panicle branching, the transcriptional regulation that underlies phenotypic diversity of branching across rice species has not been reported.
The independent domestications of African and Asian rice in the genus Oryza provide a comparative context to study the evolution of agronomic traits such as panicle architecture, and the mechanisms underlying parallel evolution of phenotype.
Here, we survey rice panicle phenotypes and use trancriptomics to reveal gene expression patterns associated with diversity of panicle architecture and domestication in the Oryza genus.


To reveal gene expression patterns associated with diversity of inflorescence architecture, we used detailed phenotyping of panicles from domesticated and wild accessions of Asian and African rice. We selected five accessions for whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq). Our analysis reveals an association between expression of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes and panicle architecture.
