# Introduction

Rice produces grains on much branched inflorescences, called panicles.
The branch complexity of a panicle and eventually the number of grains that grow on it are determined by iterations of two basic developmental decisions on axillary meristems: (i) How many axillary meristem should be produced by a branch, and (ii) should one axillary meristem grow into a higher order branch or differentiate into a spikelet and eventually into one grain.
In detail, the rice panicle develops from a main stem named Rachis, which, while growing, produces a small indeterminate number axillary meristems.
All of those meristems develop as primary branches.
Primary branches also produces an indeterminate number of axillary meristems; any of those meristems could grow as secondary branches but also differentiate into spikelets.
Eventually, secondary branches produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems which rarely grow into tertiary branches and likely differentiate into spikelets.
One rice spikelet produces one single grain.
These events shape the complexity of rice panicles.

Panicle branching and the number of grains per panicle change consistently among the many clades, species and varieties of rice that have evolved during rice complex domestication history.
Two clades of rice: the Asian and African clades, split around two millions years ago and have been domesticated independently [@zhu2005phylogenetic].
The domesticated Asian rice *O. sativa* appeared 10000 years ago and went through a convoluted domestication history that involves a network of subspecies, most importantly *O. sativa indica* and *O. sativa japonica* and frequent introgressions of its wild relative *O. rufipogon*.
Rice species in this Asian clade tend to produce panicles with more branches and more grains.
Instead, the domesticated African rice *O. glaberrima* has a simpler history: it was domesticated only 3000 years ago and doesn't show signs of introgressions from its wild relative *O. barthii* [Reviewed by @vaughan2008evolving].
Rice species in this African clade tend to produce simpler panicles mostly based on primary branches
In both African and Asian rice clades, when compared to their wild relatives, domesticated species tend to produce panicles that are more complex and ramified.

The topology and quantity of panicles branches are controlled by genes that determine the size, rate of maturation and identity of reproductive and axillary meristems.
Many of those genes have been described and their activity is often not limited to the reproductive phase, but, rather, it spans many developmental phases.
The main known branch gene *TAWAWA1*, is an ALOG transcription factor that keeps the apical meristem indeterminate [@yoshida2013tawawa1].
Instead, the genes *LAX Panicles 1*, *LAX Panicles 2* [@komatsu2001lax1, @tabuchi2011lax], instead, encode for a bHLH and a protein with a novel domain that control the establishment of axillary meristem, which affects both vegetative and panicle branching.
Moreover *Aberrant Panicle Organization 1* and *Aberrant Panicle organization 2* are ortholog to *Arabidopsis* *UFO*.
They control meristem phase transitions; and, when those genes are missing, meristems tend to spikelets and branching is reduced [@ikeda2012aberrant].

***I am not sure which other gene to discuss here, which one do we consider focal for our paper? If we include more genes we could consider dividing them in -indeterminate apical meristem, establishment of axyllary meristem, progression to spikelet.***
