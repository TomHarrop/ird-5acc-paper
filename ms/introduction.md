Rice produces grains on complex multi-branched inflorescences, called panicles.
The complexity of a panicle and eventually the number of grains that develop on it are determined by the iteration of two basic developmental decisions about axillary meristems: (i) How many axillary meristem should a branch produce, and (ii) should a single axillary meristem grow into a secondary order branch or differentiate into a spikelet and eventually into a grain.
~~Multiple developmental events determine the panicle branch structure and eventually its number of grains~~.
In detail, the rice panicle develops from a main stem named Rachis, which, while growing, produces in spiral phyllotaxis an indeterminate number axillary meristems.
All of those meristems develop as primary branches.
Primary branches also produces in alternate phyllotaxis an indeterminate number of axillary meristems, any of those meristems could develop as secondary branches or could differentiate into spikelets.
Also secondary branches produce an indeterminate but smaller number of axillary meristems which rarely develop into tertiary branches and likely all differentiate into spikelets.
One rice spikelet produces one single grain. This combination of events determines the complexity of rice panicles.
