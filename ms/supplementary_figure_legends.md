Principal component analysis (PCA) of panicle phenotyping data showing components 1–4.
PC1 accounts for 46.5% of variability and separates panicles from domesticated and wild accessions.
The lower ordinates do not separate panicles by species.](figures/Figure_S2.pdf)

The accessions used for RNAseq are consistent with species-wide patterns of panicle architecture.
The *y*-axis shows the projection of each panicle on principal component 1 (PC1), which separates wild and domesticated accessions (Fig. 1).
The accessions chosen for RNAseq are shown in red.
Accessions used for phenotyping are listed in supporting information Table S1.

Early stages of rice panicle development used for gene expression analysis.
(**a**) Developmental stages of immature panicles collected for expression analysis.
Stage 1: rachis meristem;
Stage 2: indeterminate meristem (IM) stage with formation of primary branch meristems, elongation of primary branch meristem and formation of axillary meristem;
Stage 3: determinate meristem (DM) stage with spikelet meristem and floret differentiation;
Stage 4: floret displaying early floral organ differentiation.
The scale bar indicates 100 μm.
(**b**) Quantitative RT-PCR using meristem stage-specific marker genes for validation of staging.
AM: axillary meristem;
ePBM: elongating primary branch meristem;
FlM: floret meristem;
l: lemma; 
p: palea;
PBM: primary branch meristem;
RM: Rachis meristem;
SpM: spikelet meristem;
St: stamen.

Heatmap of pairwise distances between RNAseq samples.
Samples group by stage, species and continent.
The numbers indicate single samples (three replicates per accession per stage).
The axes are ordered by hierarchical clustering of Minkowski distances between samples.

Phenotyping of the four *Oryza* accessions used for RNAseq.
These plants were grown at the same time and in the same conditions as the plants used for gene expression analysis.
The domesticated accessions produce more spikelets and secondary branches than their wild relatives.
The domesticated accessions have a similar number of primary branches, but the Asian domesticated species has more secondary branches and spikelets than the domesticated African species.](figures/Figure_S7.pdf)

Most genes in cluster 5 have negative L~2~FCs between IM and DM in *O. rufipogon*, *O. barthii* and *O. glaberrima*, but L~2~FCs in *O. sativa indica* are closer to zero.
This cluster has an enrichment of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.
