**Figure S1 PanicleStructure**.
Spread mature rice panicle. RL: Rachis length; PB: Primary branch; PBL: Primary branch length; PBIL: Primary branch internode length; SB, Secondary branch; SBL: Secondary branch length; SBIL: Secondary branch internode length; Sp : Spikelet.

**Figure S2 phenotype-pca-all-pc**.
Principal component analysis (PCA) of panicle phenotyping data showing components 1–4.
PC1 accounts for 46.5% of variability and separates panicles from domesticated and wild accessions.
The lower ordinates do not separate panicles by species.

**Figure S3 phenotype-all-varieties**.
The accessions used for RNAseq are consistent with species-wide patterns of panicle architecture.
The *y*-axis shows the projection of each panicle on principal component 1 (PC1), which separates wild and domesticated accessions (**Figure 1**).
We measured 3 to 9 panicles from 1 to 3 plants for each accession.
Scores on PC1 for the accessions chosen for RNAseq are shown in red.

**Figure S4 qpcr-confirms-sampling**.
Early stages of rice panicle development used for gene expression analysis.
(**A**) Developmental stages of immature panicles collected for expression analysis.
Stage 1: rachis meristem;
Stage 2: indeterminate meristem (IM) stage with formation of primary branch meristems, elongation of primary branch meristem and formation of axillary meristem;
Stage 3: determinate meristem (DM) stage with spikelet meristem and floret differentiation;
Stage 4: floret displaying early floral organ differentiation.
The scale bar indicates 100 μm.
(**B**) Quantitative RT-PCR using meristem stage-specific marker genes for validation of staging.
AM, axillary meristem;
SpM, spikelet meristem;
RM, Rachis meristem;
PBM, primary branch meristem;
ePBM, elongating primary branch meristem;
FlM, floret meristem;
St, stamen;
p, palea;
l, lemma.

**Figure S5 distance-heatmap**.
Heatmap of pairwise distances between RNAseq samples.
Samples group by stage, species and continent.
The numbers indicate single samples (three replicates per accession per stage).
The axes are ordered by hierarchical clustering of Minkowski distances between samples.

**Figure S6 NAC-HB-SPL-heatmap**.
Expression of genes from selected transcription families.
While Homeobox and *SBP* genes are expressed preferentially in the DM, *NAC* are more expressed in the IM.
We used the 10% of genes that have the highest absolute loading on PC5.
Genes in the upper panels have a positive loading on PC5 (corresponding to higher expression at the IM stage), whilst genes in the lower panels have a negative loading.
Clades for Homeobox genes are from the Plant Transcription Factor Database v4.0 [@jinPlantTFDBCentralHub2017].

**Figure S7 lmd-paper-ap2**.
Expression of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes in *O. sativa japonica* cv. Nipponbare meristems [data from @harropGeneExpressionProfiling2016].
Both genes are expressed at all stages.
*PLT8* expression peaks in RM.
RM, rachis meristem; PBM, primary branch meristem; ePBM/AM, extending primary branch meristem and axillary meristem; SM, spikelet meristem.

**Figure S8 fluidigm-ap2-hb**.
Expression analysis along early panicle development of AP2-like and Homeobox genes present in Cluster 4 and 5.
Stage 1 to 4 corresponds respectively to Rachis Meristem, Indeterminate Meristem, Determinate meristem and Flower.

**Figure S9 cluster-5-details**.
Most genes in cluster 5 have negative L~2~FCs between BM and SM in *O. rufipogon*, *O. barthii* and *O. glaberrima*, but L~2~FCs in *O. sativa indica* are closer to zero.
This cluster has an enrichment of *AP2/EREBP*-like genes.

**Figure S10 phenotyping-mpl**.
Detailed phenotyping of the five Oryza accessions used for RNAseq.
We phenotyped 9 panicles from each accession.
Plants for this dataset were grown together in controlled, greenhouse conditions, separately to the plants used for the 91-accession survey, using the same conditions as plants that were used for RNAseq.
The three domesticated accessions produce more spikelets and secondary branches than their wild relatives.
The domesticated accessions have a similar number of primary branches, but Asian domesticated species have more secondary branches and spikelets than domesticated African accessions.
In comparison to *O. sativa japonica*, *O. sativa indica* produces more secondary branches.
