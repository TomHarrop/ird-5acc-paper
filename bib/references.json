These “inflorescences” arise from stem cell populations in shoot meristems that mature gradually to reproductive states in response to environmental and endogenous signals. The morphology of the shoot meristem maturation process is conserved across distantly related plants, raising the question of how diverse inflorescence architectures arise from seemingly common maturation programs. In tomato and related nightshades (Solanaceae), inflorescences range from solitary flowers to highly branched structures bearing hundreds of flowers. Since reproductive barriers between even closely related Solanaceae have precluded a genetic dissection, we captured and compared meristem maturation transcriptomes from five domesticated and wild species reflecting the evolutionary continuum of inflorescence complexity. We find these divergent species share hundreds of dynamically expressed genes, enriched for transcription factors. Meristem stages are defined by distinct molecular states and point to modified maturation schedules underlying architectural variation. These modified schedules are marked by a peak of transcriptome expression divergence during the reproductive transition, driven by heterochronic shifts of dynamic genes, including transcriptional regulators with known roles in flowering. Thus, evolutionary diversity in Solanaceae inflorescence complexity is determined by subtle modifications of transcriptional programs during a critical transitional window of meristem maturation, which we propose underlies similar cases of plant architectural variation. More broadly, our findings parallel the recently described transcriptome “inverse hourglass” model for animal embryogenesis, suggesting both plant and animal morphological variation is guided by a mid-development period of transcriptome divergence.","URL":"http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/11/07/gr.207837.116","DOI":"10.1101/gr.207837.116","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Zachary H."},{"family":"Park","given":"Soon Ju"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Eck","given":"Joyce Van"},{"family":"Schatz","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Lippman","given":"Zachary B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,7]]},"PMID":"27821409","container-title-short":"Genome Res."},

This system serves as a model for studying adaptation, genome evolution, and the genetics and evolution of complex traits. To examine how domestication has reshaped the transcriptome of maize seedlings, we used expression profiling of 18,242 genes for 38 diverse maize genotypes and 24 teosinte genotypes. We detected evidence for more than 600 genes having significantly different expression levels in maize compared with teosinte. Moreover, more than 1,100 genes showed significantly altered coexpression profiles, reflective of substantial rewiring of the transcriptome since domestication. The genes with altered expression show a significant enrichment for genes previously identified through population genetic analyses as likely targets of selection during maize domestication and improvement; 46 genes previously identified as putative targets of selection also exhibit altered expression levels and coexpression relationships. We also identified 45 genes with altered, primarily higher, expression in inbred relative to outcrossed teosinte. These genes are enriched for functions related to biotic stress and may reflect responses to the effects of inbreeding. This study not only documents alterations in the maize transcriptome following domestication, identifying several genes that may have contributed to the evolution of maize, but highlights the complementary information that can be gained by combining gene expression with population genetic analyses.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/29/11878","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1201961109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Swanson-Wagner","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Briskine","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Schaefer","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hufford","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"Ross-Ibarra","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Myers","given":"Chad L."},{"family":"Tiffin","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Springer","given":"Nathan M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,17]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,27]]},"PMID":"22753482","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

For example, wheat spikes vary considerably in the number of spikelets, which are specialized reproductive branches, and the number of florets, which are spikelet branches that produce seeds. The large and repetitive nature of the three homologous and highly similar subgenomes of wheat has impeded attempts at using genetic approaches to uncover beneficial alleles that can be utilized for yield improvement. Using a population-associative transcriptomic approach, we analyzed the transcriptomes of developing spikes in 90 wheat lines comprising 74 landrace and 16 elite varieties and correlated expression with variations in spike complexity traits. In combination with coexpression network analysis, we inferred the identities of genes related to spike complexity. Importantly, further experimental studies identified regulatory genes whose expression is associated with and influences spike complexity. The associative transcriptomic approach utilized in this study allows rapid identification of the genetic basis of important agronomic traits in crops with complex genomes.","URL":"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/175/2/746","DOI":"10.1104/pp.17.00694","ISSN":"0032-0889, 1532-2548","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuange"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Haopeng"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Caihuan"},{"family":"Sajjad","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Caixia"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiangfeng"},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Yuling"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,16]]},"PMID":"28807930"},

After induction of flowering, the complexity of branching, and therefore the number of seeds on the panicle, is determined by the activity of different meristem types and the timing of transitions between them. Although some of the genes involved in these transitions have been identified, an understanding of the network of transcriptional regulators controlling this process is lacking. To address this we used a precise laser microdissection and RNA-sequencing approach in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare to produce quantitative data that describe the landscape of gene expression in four different meristem types: the rachis meristem, the primary branch meristem, the elongating primary branch meristem (including axillary meristems), and the spikelet meristem. A switch in expression profile between apical and axillary meristem types followed by more gradual changes during transitions in axillary meristem identity was observed, and several genes potentially involved in branching were identified. This resource will be vital for a mechanistic understanding of the link between inflorescence development and grain yield.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13147/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/tpj.13147","ISSN":"1365-313X","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Harrop","given":"Thomas W.

In this model, early events in development are less conserved across species but lead to a highly conserved ‘phylotypic period’. Beyond this stage, the model suggests that development once again becomes less conserved, leading to the diversity of forms. Recent comparative studies of gene expression in animal groups have provided strong support for the hourglass model. How and why might such an hourglass pattern be generated? More importantly, how might early acting events in development evolve while still maintaining a later conserved stage?Scope The discovery that an hourglass pattern may also exist in the embryogenesis of plants provides comparative data that may help us explain this phenomenon. Whether the developmental hourglass occurs in plants, and what this means for our understanding of embryogenesis in plants and animals is discussed. Models by which conserved early-acting genes might change their functional role in the evolution of gene networks, how networks buffer these changes, and how that might constrain, or confer diversity, of the body plan are also discused.Conclusions Evidence of a morphological and molecular hourglass in plant and animal embryogenesis suggests convergent evolution. This convergence is likely due to developmental constraints imposed upon embryogenesis by the need to produce a viable embryo with an established body plan, controlled by the architecture of the underlying gene regulatory networks. As the body plan is largely laid down during the middle phases of embryo development in plants and animals, then it is perhaps not surprising this stage represents the narrow waist of the hourglass where the gene regulatory networks are the oldest and most robust and integrated, limiting species diversity and constraining morphological space.","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/117/5/833/1742816","DOI":"10.1093/aob/mcw024","ISSN":"0305-7364","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Cridge","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Dearden","given":"Peter K."},{"family":"Brownfield","given":"Lynette R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]]},"container-title-short":"Ann Bot"}
