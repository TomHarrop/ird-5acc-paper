## TO DO

- plan results
- genes between species within stages between all 5 species
     - a lot of comparisons, also try with an LRT (species factor)
- all domestication comparisons
- extract results for phenylalanine & fumaric acid pathways
- DE by continent (no interaction)
- DE by domestication (no interaction)
- clustering of genes e.g. fuzzy c-means, tSNE etc. to find patterns in TF sets etc. Have to think of something smart to cluster, see nightshade paper cf.
- cluster all TFs from database against expression data
- still want stage between species

- link DE genes to SNP data from IRRIGEN

- promoter analysis AP2 genes DE
