## TO DO

- plan results
- genes between species within stages between all 5 species
     - a lot of comparisons, also try with an LRT (species factor)
- all domestication comparisons
- extract results for phenylalanine & fumaric acid pathways
- DE by continent (no interaction)
- DE by domestication (no interaction)
- clustering of genes e.g. fuzzy c-means, tSNE etc. to find patterns in TF sets etc. Have to think of something smart to cluster, see nightshade paper cf.
- still want stage between species

- link DE genes to SNP data from IRRIGEN
- promoter analysis AP2 genes DE
- use clusters to choose genes for promotor analysis

- cluster all genes (e.g. filtered on FDR from interaction)
- general qc stuff
- cluster z-stats

10.1104/pp.17.00694 figure 4b for clustering

Otho prefers viridis palette

ERF142 : reduce PBN SBN
PLT8 : reduce PBN

Categories of gene function? AM identity, SB elongation

Tidy up results point three, not clearly written.
Results 6: 
Results clusters: break AP2 into family and re-try enrichment analysis.
Intersperse HB and ARF genes into results
