title: "Temporary - Determination of Inflorescence Architecture in Wild and Domesticated Rices"
bibliography: ../bib/references.bib

## Introduction

* evo devo and gene expression
* transcription factors / evolution of gene regulation
* domestication and gene expression (maize, tomato transcriptomes)
* branching development in rice : undeterminated vs determinate meristem
* details about rice domestication

* **aims**:
    - Genes/pathway involved in the inflorescence determination in rice  
    - changes in phenotype, gene expression caused by / associated changes/switch/delay in determination of inflorescence 
    - Changes in phenotype link to domestication
    - common genes that respond to selection in different domestications
    - evolution of transcription factor family expression
    - does selection for the same phenotype affect expression of the same genes / sets of genes
    ## Results

    =======
    ### Panicule traits that influence spikelet number
