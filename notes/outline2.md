# AP2 gene expression regulates inflorescence architecture in domesticated rice accessions

## Introduction

1. Why is inflorescence architecture important (yield etc)? How is architecture different between domesticated and wild species?

2. How does gene expression regulate transitions in meristem identity? How do transitions in meristem identity relate to inflorescence architecture, yield?

3. How are Ap2 genes involved in meristem identity, architecture etc (maybe also stress)? (maybe in discussion)

4. Here we investigate the role of AP2 genes by blah blah, and find blah blah.

## Results

### 1. Methods summary

### 2. Panicle traits of domesticated Asian and African rice are similar.     Panicles of domesticated species produce more primary and secondary branches and more spikelets. 
- **Figure 1**: Phenotyping results *e.g.* Cali phenotyping, MTP phenotyping, PCA
- Topology / mathematics

### 3. Difference in gene expression between indeterminate and determinate meristem stages is different between domesticated/wild OR high yield/low  yield OR high branching/low branching accessions.
- **Figure 2**: global view of transcriptome *e.g.* PCA, distance heatmap, DE genes table, something else?

### 4. AP2-EREBP are the most prominently DE family in transcriptomes of developing panicles.
- **Figure 3**: PCA enrichment + AP2 heatmap.
- PCA splits genes expressed in BM and SM on component 5, AP2/ERF are the most enriched across PC5
- at least 20 AP2 are among the 400 genes preferentially expressed in BM, at least.
- DREB ERF and RAV peak earlier, and AP2 peaks later

### 5. AP2-EREBP genes are differentially expressed over a timecourse of panicle development
- **Figure 4**: fluidigm results for AP2
- If this is just confirmation / rehash of 4., we could move it to supp. If the different stages add something new, keep it in the main paper.

### 6. AP2-EREBP genes are enriched in clusters associated with yield-related traits and/or differences between wild and domesticated species
- **Figure 5 / Table 1**: clusters and correlation with phenotypes
- AP2s in cluster 4 & 5, generally they behave opposite in indica, some of them also in PC5
- Cluster1: Arag1; Cluster2: EREBP86; Cluster4: PLT9, IDS1, EREBP153; Cluster5; AP37/ERF3, DREB4-1, DREB4-2

### 7. AP2 mutants have defects in panicle branching.
- **Figure 6**: mutant characterisation

### 8. AP2-EREBP phylogeny

## Discussion

1. We found lots of evidence that AP2 genes regulate panicle branching. Discuss different mechanisms *e.g.* repression of determinate state, promotion of indeterminate state, control exhaustion of branch meristem and identity / rate of production of axillary meristem and identity of spikelet meristem. Discuss potential for changes in AP2 gene expression to be involved in evolution of branching phenotype.

2. Limitation of these results: lack of functional analysis, mutants etc. Potential for redundancy between genes. Potential contributions by genes from other families to regulatory modules.

3. How could this apply to [crop] domestication in general? What are the similarities in other branching processes e.g. root development, inflorescence development in other species?

4. What does this tell us about the evolution/development of branching architecture?
