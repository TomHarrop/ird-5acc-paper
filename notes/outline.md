# AP2 gene expression regulates inflorescence architecture 

## Introduction

1. Why is inflorescence architecture / branching important (yield etc)? How is architecture different between domesticated and wild species?

2. How does gene expression regulate transitions in meristem identity? How do transitions in meristem identity relate to inflorescence architecture, yield?

3. How are Ap2 genes involved in meristem identity, architecture etc (maybe also stress)? (maybe in discussion)

4. Here we investigate the role of AP2 genes by blah blah, and find blah blah.

## Results

### 1. Methods summary

### 2. Panicle traits of domesticated Asian and African rice are similar.     Panicles of domesticated species produce more primary and secondary branches and more spikelets. 
- **Figure 1a**: photo of mature panicles
- **Figure 1b**: Phenotyping results *e.g.* Cali phenotyping, MTP phenotyping, PCA
- correlation between spikelet number and branching complexity justifies transcriptome samples
- "evolutionary diversity in Solanaceae inflorescence complexity is determined by subtle modifications of transcriptional programs during a critical transitional window of meristem maturation" [@Lemmon_Evolutioninflorescencediversity_2016]
- Topology / mathematics

### 3. Difference in gene expression between indeterminate and determinate meristem stages is different between high yield/low  yield, high branching/low branching accessions.
- **Figure 2**: global view of transcriptome *e.g.* PCA, distance heatmap, DE genes table, something else?
- african species cluster together, asian species cluster together -> domestication changes are minor compared to species-level changes

### 4. AP2-EREBP are the most prominently DE family in transcriptomes of developing panicles.
- **Figure 3a**: PCA enrichment + AP2 heatmap.
- **Figure 3b / Table 1**: TFs differentially expressed between stages in all species (featuring AP2 genes).
- PCA splits genes expressed in BM and SM on component 5, AP2/ERF are the most enriched across PC5
- at least 20 AP2 are among the 400 genes preferentially expressed in BM, at least.
- DREB ERF and RAV peak earlier, and AP2 peaks later

### 5. AP2-EREBP genes are differentially expressed over a timecourse of panicle development
- **Figure 4**: fluidigm results for AP2
- If this only confirms 4., we could move it to supp. If the different stages add something new, keep it in the main paper.

### 6. [Differential] Expression of AP2 genes can be grouped by family
- **Figure 5**: AP2-EREBP phylogeny with gene expression
- does this fit here?

### 7. Differences in AP2 gene promoter regions are associated with differences in expression
- **Figure 6**: 
- sounds good but how?

### 8. AP2-EREBP genes are associated with yield / domestication.
- **Figure 7a / Table 2**: clusters and correlation with phenotypes (or PCA?)
- **Figure 7b / Table 3**. DE genes for interaction between stage and domestication. (enriched for AP2s).
- AP2s in cluster 4 & 5, generally they behave opposite in indica, some of them also in PC5
- Cluster1: Arag1; Cluster2: EREBP86; Cluster4: PLT9, IDS1, EREBP153; Cluster5; AP37/ERF3, DREB4-1, DREB4-2

### 9. AP2 mutants have defects in panicle branching.
- **Figure 8**: mutant characterisation

## Discussion

1. We found lots of evidence that AP2 genes regulate panicle branching. Discuss different mechanisms *e.g.* repression of determinate state, promotion of indeterminate state, control exhaustion of branch meristem and identity / rate of production of axillary meristem and identity of spikelet meristem. Links to stress response. Discuss potential for changes in AP2 gene expression to be involved in evolution of branching phenotype.

2. Limitation of these results: lack of functional analysis, mutants etc. Potential for redundancy between genes. Potential contributions by genes from other families to regulatory modules.

3. How could this apply to [crop] domestication in general? What are the similarities in other branching processes e.g. root development, inflorescence development in other species?

4. What does the AP2 story us about the evolution/development of branching architecture?

## Notes

- What about the ARF genes?
