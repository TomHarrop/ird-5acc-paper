>suggestion for an introduction plan
- general sentence about importance of rice and so panicle architecture
    - OM: I'm not sure that we should discuss general importance of rice. The importance of rice is very well known, and we do not address it directly in this paper.
    The first paragraph introduces panicle architecture, but I would not be sure how to state its importance. Is it more important then the rest of the plant?
>TH: I agree with including this, if we're going for a general journal we should make the following points in the first paragraph: 1. rice [yield] is important, 2. yield/no. of grains is controlled by panicle architecture, 3. panicle architecture is controlled by branching. If we're going for a plant journal we could skip 1. 
- how the panicle is formed: description of morphological step
    - OM: Great ,I'll add that
- what we know about molecular control
    - OM: Isn't this in the third paragraph?
- what about panicle diversity in rice and relation with domestication / refer also to paper in tomato and wheat in transcriptomic analysis (10.1101/gr.207837.116; 10.1104/pp.17.00694)

> OM: Hi,this is my reasoning behind Introduction, I was trying to keep it simple and consistent with our analysis:
- What is a panicle, how is it structured, where does its diversity arises.
    - To introduce generically the main topic.
- What is panicle diversity in different rice species and in domestication.
    - To introduce the fact that panicle diversity has not been described yet systematically and to motivate the first part our work.
- What is the molecular control of panicle development and panicle diversity
    - To introduce the second part of our work.
- What is our aim and what we have done: an exploration of panicle diversity in different species of wild and domesticated rice and of the underlying molecular genetics
