If we draft the paper on AP2s-ERF

# AP2-ERF - what is known?

stress, but stress is connected to flowering through drought-escape. Are they mis-annotated?


### initiation of crown root - PLETORA2- CRL5 - LOC_Os07g03250

crown rootless5 (crl5) produced fewer crown roots impaired initiation of crown root primordia (YUKA KITOMY 2011)

expr higher in indica Branch Meristem

Also **CRl1 LOC_Os03g05510 ARL1** higher in indica

Not in clusters

### Rice Starch regulation RSR1 LOC_Os05g03040

Seed development - starch defect in mutants. (Fu 2010)

Expressed in SM

### OsEATB LOC_Os09g28440

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEATB/

tillering and panicle branching in Indica through gibberellin (Qi et al., 2011)

**Not detected? We need to look at this more in detail**

Connected with NAC2, which is expressed in our dataset, but not differntially epxressed

### SNB LOC_Os07g13170

https://funricegenes.github.io/SNB/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem (Lee et al., 2007)

expressed but maybe not DE

not in clusters

### IDS1  LOC_Os03g60430

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsIDS1/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem and also branching with SNB (same paper)

expressed as IDS1 but DE between stages more marked

In Cluster 1

### DREB4 LOC_Os04g46400

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsDREB4-2~CR250/

expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively (Tian et al,2005)

**could this be a case of drought excape, and this just a developmental regulator?**

higher in BM

### OsEREBP1 LOC_Os02g54160

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEREBP1/

Something stress regulated

**same as above?**

Defenitely expressed, higher in spikelets

### MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 LOC_Os05g041760

Spikelet to flower meristem? (Ren et al., 2013)

**Not detected? Check better**
