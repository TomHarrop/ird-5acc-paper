If we draft the paper on AP2s-ERF

# AP2-ERF - what is known?

stress, but stress is connected to flowering through drought-escape. Are they mis-annotated?


### initiation of crown root - PLETORA2- CRL5 - LOC_Os07g03250

crown rootless5 (crl5) produced fewer crown roots impaired initiation of crown root primordia (YUKA KITOMY 2011)

expr higher in indica Branch Meristem

Also **CRl1 LOC_Os03g05510 ARL1** higher in indica

Not in clusters

### Rice Starch regulation RSR1 LOC_Os05g03040

Seed development - starch defect in mutants. (Fu 2010)

Expressed in SM

### OsEATB LOC_Os09g28440

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEATB/

tillering and panicle branching in Indica through gibberellin (Qi et al., 2011)

**Not detected? We need to look at this more in detail**

Connected with NAC2, which is expressed in our dataset, but not differntially epxressed

### SNB LOC_Os07g13170

https://funricegenes.github.io/SNB/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem (Lee et al., 2007)

expressed but maybe not DE

not in clusters

### IDS1  LOC_Os03g60430

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsIDS1/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem and also branching with SNB (same paper)

expressed as IDS1 but DE between stages more marked

In Cluster 1

### DREB4 LOC_Os04g46400

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsDREB4-2~CR250/

expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively (Tian et al,2005)

**could this be a case of drought excape, and this just a developmental regulator?**

higher in BM

### OsEREBP1 LOC_Os02g54160

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEREBP1/

Something stress regulated

**same as above?**

Defenitely expressed, higher in spikelets

### MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 LOC_Os05g041760

Spikelet to flower meristem? (Ren et al., 2013)

**Not detected? Check better**

### DREB - Multiple

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01661.x

### SHAT1 LOC_Os04g55560

https://funricegenes.github.io/SHAT1/

Seed shattering / abscission

**Definitely up in BM**

Not in clusters

### OsRAV2 LOC_Os01g04800

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsRAV2/

Activated by salt stress

**Most interesting gene? Up in BM, opposite in indica**

In cluster 5

### RAVL1 LOC_Os04g49230

https://funricegenes.github.io/RAVL1/

activates brassinosteroid and ethilene signalling

expressed but not DE (maybe up in SM)

### RAV6 LOC_Os02g45850

https://funricegenes.github.io/RAV6/

Leaf angle seed Size

expressed but not DE (maybe up in SM)


# Observations

## in Branch meristems

At least 18 up in BM (PC5), they tend to be flat in Indica, maybe morphological.

Most of them are not characterized.
