If we draft the paper on AP2s-ERF

# AP2-ERF - what is known?

stress, but stress is connected to flowering through drought-escape. Are they mis-annotated?


### initiation of crown root - PLETORA2- CRL5 - LOC_Os07g03250

crown rootless5 (crl5) produced fewer crown roots impaired initiation of crown root primordia (YUKA KITOMY 2011)

expr higher in indica Branch Meristem

Also **CRl1 LOC_Os03g05510 ARL1** higher in indica

Not in clusters

### Rice Starch regulation RSR1 LOC_Os05g03040

Seed development - starch defect in mutants. (Fu 2010)

Expressed in SM

### OsEATB LOC_Os09g28440

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEATB/

tillering and panicle branching in Indica through gibberellin (Qi et al., 2011)

**Not detected? We need to look at this more in detail**

Connected with NAC2, which is expressed in our dataset, but not differntially epxressed

### SNB LOC_Os07g13170

https://funricegenes.github.io/SNB/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem (Lee et al., 2007)

expressed but maybe not DE

not in clusters

### IDS1  LOC_Os03g60430

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsIDS1/

Transition spikelet to floral meristem and also branching with SNB (same paper)

expressed as IDS1 but DE between stages more marked

In Cluster 1

### DREB4 LOC_Os04g46400

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsDREB4-2~CR250/

expression of OsDREB4-1 was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively (Tian et al,2005)

**could this be a case of drought excape, and this just a developmental regulator?**

higher in BM

### OsEREBP1 LOC_Os02g54160

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsEREBP1/

Something stress regulated

**same as above?**

Defenitely expressed, higher in spikelets

### MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 LOC_Os05g41760

Spikelet to flower meristem? (Ren et al., 2013)

**DE between Domesticated and wild!!!!!!!**

### DREB - Multiple

### SHAT1 LOC_Os04g55560

https://funricegenes.github.io/SHAT1/

Seed shattering / abscission

**Definitely up in BM**

Not in clusters

### OsRAV2 LOC_Os01g04800

https://funricegenes.github.io/OsRAV2/

Activated by salt stress

**Most interesting gene? Up in BM, opposite in indica**

In cluster 5

### RAVL1 LOC_Os04g49230

https://funricegenes.github.io/RAVL1/

activates brassinosteroid and ethilene signalling

expressed but not DE (maybe up in SM)

### RAV6 LOC_Os02g45850

https://funricegenes.github.io/RAV6/

Leaf angle seed Size

expressed but not DE (maybe up in SM)


# Observations

## in Branch meristems

At least 18 up in BM (PC5), they tend to be flat in Indica, maybe morphological.

Many of them are not characterized.

Many characterized as response to abiotic stress. Stress triggers reproductive phase. Is it possible that these are reproductive genes that are mis-annotated as stress?

- LOC_Os01g04750: not characterizated, maybe stress
- LOC_Os08g31580: DRAP1 - abio stress
- LOC_Os04g46440: OsDERF2 - abio stress (Guo 2017)
- LOC_Os04g52090: not characterized
- LOC_Os05g41780: not characterized?
- LOC_Os01g04800: RAV2 - abio stress
- LOC_Os03g08500: BIERF4 abio stress (Cao, 2016)
- LOC_Os04g48350: GIGANTEA, abio stress? tillering?
- LOC_Os01g58420: AP37 cell death, interacts with NAc2

## in spikelet meristems

Less genes / many have been characterized as branching (a bit late) + FM identity + seed filling.

Some stress related - see above.

- LOC_Os03g12950: PLT9, ortholog of arabidopsis ANT, uncharacterized
-  LOC_Os03g60430: IDS1 - inflorescencde arch, FM identity

- LOC_Os05g03040: RSR1 seed development
- LOC_Os02g54160: OsEREBP1 more erebp close
