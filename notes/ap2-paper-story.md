I've been trying to put together our material, observations and discussions for the paper, and I also think that we should draft the paper (and make figures) around the AP2/ERF story.

It would give us a scaffold around which we can draft the paper. Once we have the scaffold done we can add also other observations on other TFs

So the main story would be:

# 1. Phenotypic analysis:

Panicles of domesticated species produce more primary and secondary branches and more spikelets

Phenotype of many varieties (Cali), Phenotypes of selected species (Montpellier) that were used for RNAseq.

We might need input from mathematicians to explain secondary branching correctly

# 2. Transcriptome, DE:

Many more DE in African species, almost none in Indica (supported also by PCA where indica samples overlap)
(Why? Indica stages are very similar)

# 3. Transcriptome, PCA:

PCA splits genes expressed in BM and SM on component 5, AP2/ERF are the most enriched across PC5,

at least 20 AP2 are among the 400 genes preferentially expressed in BM, at least.

Overall genes tend to be DE in most species besides indica where they are flat and expressed at a lower level

(AP2 could control exhaustion of branch meristem and identity / rate of production of axillary meristem and  of spikelet meristem)
(Most of them are classified as stress related genes, is it possible that actually they have a developmental function, and that the stress related function is just a side effect?)

in BM notably, RAV2, some Pletora, Many DREB, GIGANTEA, Most of them related to stress, two that interact with NAC (which are also DE)

in SM notably: PLT9, IDS1, FZP, RSR1, EREBP1, less new stuff then in BM

# 4. Transcriptome clustering

AP2s in cluster 4 & 5, generally they behave opposite in indica, some of them also in PC5

Cluster1: Arag1; Cluster2: EREBP86; Cluster4: PLT9, IDS1, EREBP153; Cluster5; AP37/ERF3, DREB4-1, DREB4-2

Same outcome as in PCA? stress related genes are DE across the stages and tend to be flat/behave opposite in Indica. Why? morphologycal. They can they have a role in controlling cell proliferation in the branching meristem


# 5. Transcripts: Fluidigm

Most interesting (that also confirm RNAseq)

OsRAV2 interesting. It responds to stress, also similarly expressed ap37, ARAG1, osBIERF4,  OsAP2âˆ’39, AP59  UP in BM, Flat or opposite in indica

Sub1b Sub1c, DE, expressed only in asian species,

PLT9, IDS9, MFS1, ERF54 Up in SM, flat or opposite in Indica


Same as in RNASEQ, most genes behave differently in Indica, they are expressed at a lower level and they do not change much expression.

# 6. Other genes that look interesting

- LOC_Os05g29810: ERF61, up in indica, not characteried
- LOC_Os07g03250: Crl5-PLT2 formatio of crown root primordia, DE in Indica
- LOC_Os03g56050: PLT7, other ortholog of AINTEGUMENTA, uncharacterized?

# 7. Plus

Mutants? Shall we discuss them in this paper?
Phylogeny? Ap2 that are DE come in group, many DREB.
Promoter sequence? At this point I would check the sequence of AP2 genes and promoters. There must be something that we can report


**Mutant summary:**

**LOC_Os08g31580 / erf48**

- Typical expression pattern of PC5, high ranking, mostly expressed in BM, (Generally, does indica starts developing earlier?)
- DREB gene,
- effect on RACHIS and PRIMARY branches:
    - Rachis shorter,
    - More Primary Branches (Maybe???),
    - Primary branches shorter,
    - Primary branch internodes shorter,
    - No effect on secondary branches,
- Also less variance in all features in the mutants

**LOC_Os07g03250 plt8 / crl 5**

- DE only in indica, Higher in BM,
- ERF gene,
- Always less variance in the mutant,
- Effect on Rachis and primary branches:
    - Rachis shorter,
    - Less primary branches,
    - Both order branches longer?
    - Maybe more secondary branches and more spikelet? Small effect,

**LOC_Os05g32270 erf142 &&& LOC_Os06g03710 smo2 ???**

They behave always the same, erf142 has more extreme values.

- erf142 classified as DREB by Sharoni et al and as Unusual AP2 by Aya et al, 2014, which is the one that reported the mutant.
- Everything is smaller, besides, strangely, SbIntL, which gets longer.
-  It makes significantly less Sb and Sp, which fits with its function in Auxin signalling pathway.




# Conclusions:

**So, this is the point. Many AP2 are DE and seem to be active in the branch meristem. Do they have a developmental function?

Many of the have been related to stress. If we find evidence that they are connected to stress only as a side effect of being developmental genes, and that they instead control panicle and reproductive development, this could be a very good story for the paper.

Many of them behave differently in the various species, so they can control to some level panicle diversity.
Indeed they could control exhaustion of branch meristem and identity / rate of production of axillary meristem and identity of spikelet meristem

As mentioned above, I would make figures and draft the paper around the AP2/ERF story and on side add all the observation that we have on other genes.**

(I would stick to the AP2/ERF story at least for the first version, then we could see if it has enough novelty and what's missing)

What do you think?
