Hi Everybody.

Sorry for the mid summer email. I'm at my father's place for some holidays and I write when I have internet connection. Please, feel free to take your time to answer.

First, for organizing the work, if you want to start from the figures, I can adapt to it.

Moreover, regarding AP2-EREBP: I think that we have a nice overlap between expression and phylogeny. I've taken the phylogeny (subfamilies) from Sharoni et al., 2010 (https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/52/2/344/1905524) and added it to the PC5. RAV subfamily is expressed more in the Branch Meristem, DREB also. While the AP2 subfamily is expressed more in the Spikelet Meristem.

This split is also supported by the cluster. Cluster 2 and 4 contain exclusively AP2s, while The other clusters, especially cluster 5, contain exclusively the other subfamilies.

In the attachment I've plotted all the AP2-EREBP ranked as in PC5. In the two last lines of the annotation I've added the subfamily from Sharoni 2010 and the cluster (if any). Please, check if you can observe this pattern.

So, to wrap up. Does this add something to our AP2 story? We have many DREB and RAV expressed preferentially in the BM (and RAV2 looks very interesting, also from the fluidigm data). Those genes have been linked more to stress than to development. Can we make a link to development?

And to domestication? Some of the AP2-EREBP change expression between species. We could have a story about stress + development + balance of resources during panicle development in wild and domesticated plants.

Best :)
